    <h1>What is Childrens Obesity?</h1>
    <p>Childhood obesity in the UK refers to a condition where children have excess body fat that negatively affects their health and well-being. It is often measured using the Body Mass Index (BMI), where children at or above the 95th percentile are considered obese. This condition is a significant public health concern due to its association with various health issues, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and emotional difficulties. Contributing factors include poor diet, lack of physical activity, and genetic predisposition. Efforts to combat childhood obesity in the UK focus on promoting healthy eating habits, increasing physical activity, and creating supportive environments at home, school, and within the community.</p>
